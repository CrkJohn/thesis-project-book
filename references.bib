title={Inteligencia de fuentes abiertas para el contexto colombiano},
abstract={Open source intelligence (OSINT) is used to obtain and analyze information related to adversaries, so it can support risk assessments aimed to prevent damages against critical assets. This paper presents a research about different OSINT technologies and how these can be used to perform cyber intelligence tasks. One of the key components in the operation of OSINT tools are the “transforms”, which are used to establish relations between entities of information from queries to different open sources. A set of transforms addressed to the Colombian context are presented, which were implemented and contributed to the community allowing to the law enforcement agencies to develop information gathering process from Colombian open sources. Additionally, this paper shows the implementation of three machine learning models used to perform sentiment analysis over the information obtained from an adversary. Sentiment analysis can be extremely useful to understand the motivation that an adversary can have and, in this way, define proper cyber defense strategies. Finally, some challenges related to the application of OSINT techniques are identified and described.},

abstract = {Consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews in order to make an informed prod- uct choice. This paper introduces OPINE, an unsupervised information- extraction system which mines re- views in order to build a model of im- portant product features, their evalu- ation by reviewers, and their relative quality across products. Compared to previous work, OPINE achieves 22{\%} higher precision (with only 3{\%} lower recall) on the feature extraction task. OPINE's novel use of relaxation labeling for finding the se- mantic orientation of words in con- text leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a variety of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based models for sequence tagging. These models include LSTM networks, bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM) networks, LSTM with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (LSTM-CRF) and bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer (BI-LSTM-CRF). Our work is the first to apply a bidirectional LSTM CRF (denoted as BI-LSTM-CRF) model to NLP benchmark sequence tagging data sets. We show that the BI-LSTM-CRF model can efficiently use both past and future input features thanks to a bidirectional LSTM component. It can also use sentence level tag information thanks to a CRF layer. The BI-LSTM-CRF model can produce state of the art (or close to) accuracy on POS, chunking and NER data sets. In addition, it is robust and has less dependence on word embedding as compared to previous observations.},

@article{Kingma2014,
abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Novel fibrous Al2O3-(m-ZrO2)/t-ZrO2 (m, monoclinic; t, tetragonal) composites having a core/shell structure were fabricated by multi-extrusion, and their microstructures and material properties were investigated depending on the number of extrusions. The composites acquired a homogeneously fine fibrous structure as the number of extrusions increased. The bending strength and fracture toughness increased remarkably as the number of extrusions increased. In the fracture surface of the second passed composite, an Al2O3-(m-ZrO2) core region appeared, flat type, although some local regions existed with an intergranular fracture. However, the fracture mode of the t-ZrO2 region was of intergranular type having a sharp and rough surface. In the composite made by the fifth passed extrusion, the fracture strength and toughness values were high at about 665 MPa and 9.6 MPa(.)m(/2), respectively. The main fracture mode was a typical intergranular mode having a rough fracture surface, and the main multi-toughening was because of mechanisms such as crack bridging, microcracking, and phase transformation},
