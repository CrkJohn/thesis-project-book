title={Inteligencia de fuentes abiertas para el contexto colombiano},
abstract={Open source intelligence (OSINT) is used to obtain and analyze information related to adversaries, so it can support risk assessments aimed to prevent damages against critical assets. This paper presents a research about different OSINT technologies and how these can be used to perform cyber intelligence tasks. One of the key components in the operation of OSINT tools are the “transforms”, which are used to establish relations between entities of information from queries to different open sources. A set of transforms addressed to the Colombian context are presented, which were implemented and contributed to the community allowing to the law enforcement agencies to develop information gathering process from Colombian open sources. Additionally, this paper shows the implementation of three machine learning models used to perform sentiment analysis over the information obtained from an adversary. Sentiment analysis can be extremely useful to understand the motivation that an adversary can have and, in this way, define proper cyber defense strategies. Finally, some challenges related to the application of OSINT techniques are identified and described.},

Our work is the first to apply a bidirectional LSTM CRF (denoted as BI-LSTM-CRF) model to NLP benchmark sequence tagging data sets. We show that the BI-LSTM-CRF model can efficiently use both past and future input features thanks to a bidirectional LSTM component. It can also use sentence level tag information thanks to a CRF layer. The BI-LSTM-CRF model can produce state of the art (or close to) accuracy on POS, chunking and NER data sets. In addition, it is robust and has less dependence on word embedding as compared to previous observations.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The composites acquired a homogeneously fine fibrous structure as the number of extrusions increased. The bending strength and fracture toughness increased remarkably as the number of extrusions increased. In the fracture surface of the second passed composite, an Al2O3-(m-ZrO2) core region appeared, flat type, although some local regions existed with an intergranular fracture. However, the fracture mode of the t-ZrO2 region was of intergranular type having a sharp and rough surface. In the composite made by the fifth passed extrusion, the fracture strength and toughness values were high at about 665 MPa and 9.6 MPa(.)m(/2), respectively. The main fracture mode was a typical intergranular mode having a rough fracture surface, and the main multi-toughening was because of mechanisms such as crack bridging, microcracking, and phase transformation},

However, the number of forums, their size, and the domain expertise required to understand the markets makes manual exploration of these forums unscalable. In this work, we propose an automated, top-down approach for analyzing underground forums. Our approach uses natural language processing and machine learning to automatically generate high-level information about underground forums, first identifying posts related to transactions, and then extracting products and prices. We also demonstrate, via a pair of case studies, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to investigate other categories of products and transactions. We use eight distinct forums to assess our tools: Antichat, Blackhat World, Carders, Darkode, Hack Forums, Hell, L33tCrew and Nulled. Our automated approach is fast and accurate, achieving over 80{\%} accuracy in detecting post category, product, and prices.},

abstract = {Abstract-There has been a rapid growth in the number of cybercr imes that cause tremendous financial loss to organizations. Recent studies reveal that cybercriminals tend to collaborate or even transact cyber-attack tools via the dark markets established in online social media. Accordingly, it presents unprecedented opportunities for researchers to tap into these underground cybercriminal communities to develop better insights about collaborative cybercrime activities so as to combat the ever increasing number of cybercrimes. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel weakly supervised cybercriminal network mining method to facilitate cybercrime forensics. In particular, the proposed method is underpinned by a probabilistic generative model enhanced by a novel context-sensitive Gibbs sampling algorithm. Evaluated based on two social media corpora, our experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based method and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method by 5.23{\%} and 16.62{\%} in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), respectively. It also achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful research of applying a probabilistic generative model to mine cybercriminal networks from online social media. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Some multilingual forums exist where cybercriminals of differing geopolitical origin interact and exchange hacking knowledge and cybercriminal assets. Researchers can study such forums to better understand the global cybercriminal supply chain and cybercrime trends. However, little work has focused on identifying members of different language groups and geopolitical origin within such forums. One challenge is the necessity of a technique that scales across multiple languages. We are motivated to explore computational techniques that support automated and scalable categorization of cybercriminal forum participants into varying language groups. In particular, we make use of Paragraph Vectors, a state-of-The-Art neural network language model to generate fixed-length vector representations (i.e., document embeddings) of messages posted by forum participants. Results indicate Paragraph Vectors outperforms traditional n-gram frequency approaches for generating document embeddings that are useful for clustering cybercriminals into language groups. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was originally developed during World War II to analyze classification accuracy in differentiating signal from noise in radar detection.1 Recently, the methodology has been adapted to several clinical areas heavily dependent on screening and diagnostic tests,2–4 in particular, laboratory testing,5 epidemi- ology,6 radiology,7–9 and bioinformatics.10 ROC analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the perfor- mance of diagnostic tests and more generally for evaluating the accuracy of a statistical model (eg, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis) that classifies subjects into 1 of 2 categories, diseased or nondiseased. Its function as a simple graphical tool for displaying the accuracy of a medical diagnostic test is one of the most well-known applications of ROC curve analysis. In Circulation from January 1, 1995, through December 5, 2005, 309 articles were published with the key phrase “receiver operating characteristic.” In cardiol- ogy, diagnostic testing plays a fundamental role in clinical practice (eg, serum markers of myocardial necrosis, cardiac imaging tests). Predictive modeling to estimate expected outcomes such as mortality or adverse cardiac events based on patient risk characteristics also is common in cardiovas- cular research. ROC analysis is a useful tool in both of these situations. In this article, we begin by reviewing the measures of accuracy—sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)—that use the ROC curve. We also illustrate how these measures can be applied using the evaluation of a hypothet- ical new diagnostic test as an example. Diagnostic},
